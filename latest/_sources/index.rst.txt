Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis for Python
================================================

These are a set of Python bindings to `Charlie Conroy's Flexible Stellar
Population Synthesis (FSPS) Fortran library
<https://github.com/cconroy20/fsps>`_.
Python-FSPS makes it easy to generate spectra and magnitudes for arbitrary
stellar populations.
These bindings are updated in conjunction with FSPS, and are known to work with
FSPS v3.0.
